# Python-lexical-analyzer

## Overview

The Python Lexical Analyzer repository is dedicated to a lexical analysis tool designed specifically for Python code. The tool parses Python code files and generates lexical tokens based on the language's syntax rules. This repository provides the necessary modules and scripts to perform lexical analysis on Python programs, aiding in code understanding and processing.

## Files

- **LexicalAnalyzer.py:** Python module containing the implementation of the lexical analyzer.
- **Token.py:** Python module defining the structure of lexical tokens.
- **TokenType.py:** Python module defining the types of tokens recognized by the lexical analyzer.
- **lexical_analyzer_output.txt:** Output file containing the lexical tokens generated by the analyzer.
- **main.py:** Python script for executing the lexical analysis process.
- **my_python_program.py:** Sample Python program file to be analyzed.

## Usage

To perform lexical analysis on a Python program using this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all Python files to be analyzed are placed in the same directory as the repository files.
2. Run the `main.py` script, passing the name of the Python program file to be analyzed as an argument.
3. The lexical analyzer will parse the input Python program, generate lexical tokens, and save the output to `lexical_analyzer_output.txt`.
4. Review the output file to examine the lexical tokens generated from the input Python program.

## Example

```bash
python main.py my_python_program.py
```

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies required to use the Python Lexical Analyzer. The repository includes all necessary modules and scripts for lexical analysis.
